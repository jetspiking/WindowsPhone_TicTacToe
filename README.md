TicTacToe Ultimate for Windows Phone / PC

Enjoy Tic Tac Toe with up to four players and a variable game size. The application is released with a Halloween theme (which can be disabled in the settings) and special player icons. TicTacToe Ultimate also uses your systems accent color, so the app changes with your mood (given that you adjust this in your Windows settings).

Landscape and portrait mode are both supported.
